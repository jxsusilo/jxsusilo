## *Welcome to my GitHub!* ^-^

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at UC Irvine.  
My interests lie in graphics, games, and web development.
I aspire to create projects that are as beautiful as they are functional, as visuals are important to me.
I love to learn; I hope to do a lot this year!

**Languages:**  
C++ | Python | Java
